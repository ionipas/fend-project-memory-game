## How to play

The game board consists of sixteen "cards" arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down. The gameplay rules are very simple: flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!

## Game behavior
- The game randomly shuffles the cards. A user wins once all cards have successfully been matched.
- When a user wins the game, a modal appears to congratulate the player and ask if they want to play again. It should also tell the user how much time it took to win the game, and what the star rating was.
- A restart button allows the player to reset the game board, the timer, and the star rating.
- The game displays a star rating (from 1-3) that reflects the player's performance. At the beginning of a game, it should display 3 stars. After 20 moves, it should change to a 2 star rating. After 30 moves, it should change to a 1 star rating.
- When the player starts a game, a displayed timer should also start. Once the player wins the game, the timer stops.
- Game displays the current number of moves a user has made.
